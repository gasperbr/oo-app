    <p class="text-making">All the Surfer surfboards are built on a traditional polyurethane core with a complete epoxy laminate and finish (known as PE construction).</p>
    <p class="text-making">The epoxy resin is known to be a higher quality material than polyester. Is more UV resistant, stronger and has more reactive flex pattern. The result is a whiter and brighter surfboard that doesnâ€™t yellow as quickly as a traditional polyester construction (aesthetics) which responds faster to your movements (performance).</p>
